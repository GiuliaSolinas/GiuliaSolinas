## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist -- what I love is training models --- based in Munich (DE) and with a career path in academia before turning into practice.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on agentic open-source frameworks, AI/GenAI pre-sales, and building demos using IBM wx orchestrate and wx ai
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning agentic AI design with a particular focus on AgentOps and governance for agents.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on inspiring projects for making AI safer for everyone.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about walking trails for toddlers in the Alps. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me on LinkedIn. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lived in Switzerland, the UK, Denmark, and Germany, but I am Italian deep in my soul, so never ask me if I fancy a pineapple pizza.
